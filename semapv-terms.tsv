semapv:MappingActivity	mapping activity	A process that relates to the creation, confirmation, rejection or curation of a mapping.	Matching is a mapping activity that results in the creating of a mapping; mapping review is an activity that results in the confirmation of a mapping.			
semapv:Matching	matching process	An process that results in a mapping between a subject and an object entity.	The label of a subject entity matches to an exact synonym of an object entity.		matching operation|matching task	semapv:MappingActivity
semapv:Mapping	mapping	A triple <s,p,o> comprising a subject entity s, an object entity o and a mapping predicate p.	The subject entity NCI:C9305 is mapped to the object entity ICD10:C80.9 using the skos:relatedMatch mapping predicate.			
semapv:LexicalMatching	lexical matching process	A matching process based on a lexical comparison between one or more syntactic features of the subject with one or more syntactic features of the object.	The label of a subject entity matches to an exact synonym of an object entity.			semapv:Matching
semapv:LogicalReasoning	logical reasoning process	A matching process based on the inferences made by a logical reasoner.	Two classes across ontologies are determined equivalent by an OWL reasoner such as ELK.			semapv:Matching
semapv:CompositeMatching	composite matching process	A matching process based on multiple, possibly intertwined, matching approaches.	An ontology matching tool determines that a subject should be mapped to an object by employing a range of techniques, including lexical, semantic and structural.			semapv:Matching
semapv:UnspecifiedMatching	unspecified matching process	A matching process based on an unspecified comparison.	A mapping between a subject and an object was established, but it is no longer clear how or why.			semapv:Matching
semapv:SemanticSimilarityThresholdMatching	semantic similarity threshold-based matching process	A matching process based on a minimum threshold of a score from a comparison based on a semantic similarity algorithm.	A match between a subject and an object entity was established because they had a Jaccard score higher than 0.8 based on the set of (common) superclasses.			semapv:Matching
semapv:LexicalSimilarityThresholdMatching	lexical similarity threshold-based matching process	A lexical matching process based on a minimum threshold of a score from a comparison based on a lexical similarity algorithm.	A match between a subject and an object was established because they had a Levenshtein score higher than 0.8.			semapv:Matching
semapv:StructuralMatching	structural matching process					semapv:Matching
semapv:InstanceBasedMatching	instance-based matching process					semapv:Matching
semapv:BackgroundKnowledgeBasedMatching	background knowledge-based matching process					semapv:Matching
semapv:MappingChaining	mapping chaining-based matching process	A matching process based on the traversing of multiple mappings.	A match between a subject A and an object B was established because A was mapped to C, C was mapped to D and D was mapped to B.			semapv:Matching
semapv:MappingReview	mapping review	A process that is concerned with determining if a mapping “candidate” (otherwise determined) is reasonable/correct.	A match between a subject A and an object B was established elsewhere, and a human reviewer determined that the mapping is true (or false) based on an independent evaluation.			semapv:MappingActivity
semapv:ManualMappingCuration	manual mapping curation	An matching process that is performed by a human agent and is based on human judgement and domain knowledge.	A human curator determines that a subject should be mapped to an object by virtue of their domain expertise.			semapv:MappingActivity
semapv:MatchingPreprocessing	matching process pre-processing	A preliminary processing of inputs prior to performing matching.				semapv:MappingActivity
semapv:Stemming	stemming	The process of reducing a word to its word stem.				semapv:MatchingPreprocessing
semapv:Lemmatization	lemmatization	The process of reducing the different forms of a word to one single form.				semapv:MatchingPreprocessing
semapv:StopWordRemoval	stop-word removal	A preprocessing method transforming a string by removing a list of stop words.	The stop-words “of, and, is, a” are removed from the label field of the subject entity in the mapping.			semapv:MatchingPreprocessing
semapv:RegexRemoval	regex removal	A preprocessing method transforming a string by matching a regular expression and then removing that match.	The regex match “[ -]phenotype” is removed from the label field of the subject entity in the mapping.			semapv:MatchingPreprocessing
semapv:RegexReplacement	regex replacement	A preprocessing method transforming a string by matching a regular expression and then replacing that match with a specified substitution string.	The regex match “[ -]phenotype” is replaced by “-disease” for the label field of the subject entity in the mapping.			semapv:MatchingPreprocessing
semapv:MatchingPostProcessing	matching process post-processing	A process applied to a set of mappings, usually with the intention of changing it.				semapv:MappingActivity
semapv:ThresholdFiltering	threshold filtering					semapv:MatchingPostProcessing
semapv:StableMarriageFitering						semapv:MatchingPostProcessing
semapv:CardinalityFiltering						semapv:MatchingPostProcessing
semapv:LogicalConsistencyFiltering						semapv:MatchingPostProcessing
semapv:EntityAlignmentMatching	An alignment based on entity matching (e.g., using knowledge graph embedding models)
