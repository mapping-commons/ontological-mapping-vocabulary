semapv:MappingActivity	mapping activity	A process that relates to the creation, confirmation, rejection or curation of a mapping.		Matching is a mapping activity that results in the creating of a mapping; mapping review is an activity that results in the confirmation of a mapping.			
semapv:Matching	matching process	An process that results in a mapping between a subject and an object entity.		The label of a subject entity matches to an exact synonym of an object entity.		matching operation|matching task	semapv:MappingActivity
semapv:Mapping	mapping	A triple <s,p,o> comprising a subject entity s, an object entity o and a mapping predicate p.		The subject entity NCI:C9305 is mapped to the object entity ICD10:C80.9 using the skos:relatedMatch mapping predicate.			
semapv:LexicalMatching	lexical matching process	A matching process based on a lexical comparison between one or more syntactic features of the subject with one or more syntactic features of the object.		The label of a subject entity matches to an exact synonym of an object entity.			semapv:Matching
semapv:LogicalReasoning	logical reasoning matching process	A matching process based on the inferences made by a logical reasoner.		Two classes across ontologies are determined equivalent by an OWL reasoner such as ELK.			semapv:Matching
semapv:CompositeMatching	composite matching process	A matching process based on multiple, possibly intertwined, matching approaches.		An ontology matching tool determines that a subject should be mapped to an object by employing a range of techniques, including lexical, semantic and structural.			semapv:Matching
semapv:UnspecifiedMatching	unspecified matching process	A matching process based on an unspecified comparison.		A mapping between a subject and an object was established, but it is no longer clear how or why.			semapv:Matching
semapv:SemanticSimilarityThresholdMatching	semantic similarity threshold-based matching process	A matching process based on a minimum threshold of a score from a comparison based on a semantic similarity algorithm.		A match between a subject and an object entity was established because they had a Jaccard score higher than 0.8 based on the set of (common) superclasses.			semapv:Matching
semapv:LexicalSimilarityThresholdMatching	lexical similarity threshold-based matching process	A lexical matching process based on a minimum threshold of a score from a comparison based on a lexical similarity algorithm.		A match between a subject and an object was established because they had a Levenshtein score higher than 0.8.			semapv:Matching
semapv:StructuralMatching	structural matching process		https://doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2009.11.002	A match between a subject and an object was established because of the similarity of their structural features, e.g., the number of direct property of a class.	Structural matching does not involve looking at "values" of properties.		semapv:Matching
semapv:InstanceBasedMatching	instance-based matching process	A matching process based on individual representations (or instances).	https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38721-0	A match between a subject A and an object B was established because they share the same instances.			semapv:Matching
semapv:BackgroundKnowledgeBasedMatching	background knowledge-based matching process	A matching process that exploits background knowledge from external resources, commonly referred to as background knowledge resources. This approach is also known as indirect matching, BK-based matching or context-based matching.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2018.04.001	A match between a subject A and an object B was established because they appear equivalent under consideration of externally provided background knowledge.			semapv:Matching
semapv:MappingChaining	mapping chaining-based matching process	A matching process based on the traversing of multiple mappings.		A match between a subject A and an object B was established because A was mapped to C, C was mapped to D and D was mapped to B.			semapv:Matching
semapv:MappingInversion	mapping inversion-based matching process	A matching process based on the inverting or flipping of the subject with the object of a mapping in accordance with the semantics of the mapping predicate.	https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/chaining_rules/	A broad match between a subject A and an object B using the skos:narrowMatch mapping relation was established because B was mapped to A using the skos:broadMatch mapping relation.		mapping flipping|semantic walk-backs|mapping inversion|mapping inverting	semapv:Matching
semapv:MappingReview	mapping review	A process that is concerned with determining if a mapping “candidate” (otherwise determined) is reasonable/correct.		A match between a subject A and an object B was established elsewhere, and a human reviewer determined that the mapping is true (or false) based on an independent evaluation.			semapv:MappingActivity
semapv:ManualMappingCuration	manual mapping curation	An matching process that is performed by a human agent and is based on human judgement and domain knowledge.		A human curator determines that a subject should be mapped to an object by virtue of their domain expertise.			semapv:Matching
semapv:MatchingPreprocessing	matching process pre-processing	A preliminary processing of inputs prior to performing matching.					semapv:MappingActivity
semapv:Stemming	stemming	The process of reducing a word to its word stem.					semapv:Normalization
semapv:Lemmatization	lemmatization	The process of reducing the different forms of a word to one single form.	https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38721-0				semapv:Normalization
semapv:StopWordRemoval	stop-word removal	A preprocessing method transforming a string by removing a list of stop words.	https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38721-0	The stop-words “of, and, is, a” are removed from the label field of the subject entity in the mapping.			semapv:Normalization
semapv:RegexRemoval	regex removal	A preprocessing method transforming a string by matching a regular expression and then removing that match.		The regex match “[ -]phenotype” is removed from the label field of the subject entity in the mapping.			semapv:Normalization
semapv:RegexReplacement	regex replacement	A preprocessing method transforming a string by matching a regular expression and then replacing that match with a specified substitution string.		The regex match “[ -]phenotype” is replaced by “-disease” for the label field of the subject entity in the mapping.			semapv:Normalization
